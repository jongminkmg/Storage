Foundation Course III Tutoring: The Basics

What is Foundation Course III: Function and Dysfunction?

Foundation course III is an interdisciplinary course that focuses on physiology/pathophysiology, clinical pathology, pharmacology and anatomic pathology. 

The course is divided into two courses. Foundation Course IIIa occurs in the spring of the student’s first year. Foundation Course IIIb occurs in the fall of the student’s second year. Though they are separate courses, the content is taught in an integrated way such that concepts presented in Foundation Course IIIa continue to develop through Foundation Course IIIb.

What foundational knowledge will students bring with them into Foundation Course III?

Students will have already successfully completed:
Foundation Course I: The Animal Body (gross anatomy, histology and imaging)
Foundation Course II: Cell Biology and Genetics
General Pathology
Neuroanatomy
Elective anatomy course (carnivore, comparative, ruminant, equine)

I understand Foundation Course III utilizes problem-based learning. What is included in a case?

Student Case
This is the case the students will work through during a week. It includes case dialogue, clinical pathology data, and digital resources such as imaging, histology and anatomic pathology specimens when appropriate.
The student case also includes tasks. These tasks have been developed to help support objectives that are harder to naturally squeeze from the case, to help students start integrating material from one case to another and they can help us articulate our expectations. This is important: these tasks can be made into learning objectives, but they should not be the ONLY learning objectives your group develops for a day. 

Tutor Guide
This is a document that supports the tutor case and, this is important, is confidential and for the tutor’s eyes only. This document provides information for tutors on pacing, content, learning objectives, course expectations, and recommended resources for the students to use. All of our tutors come from different backgrounds and training so the guides are a resource built to support all ranges of expertise. Sometimes material presented in these documents goes into slightly more detail that we expect of the students but feel it benefits you to know to help build your understanding. We will comment on this either in the tutor guide or during tutor preparation meetings to help you navigate how deep to push your group in a subject area.
Are there any other modes of instruction that support student learning during Foundation Course III?

Absolutely! Each week is comprised of a couple chosen lecture topics. We choose our lecture topics based on subject matter that may be more challenging to understand or difficult to find. We also present lectures that strive to encourage students to take what they are learning in tutor group and apply it to a clinical situation. 

There is also a lab or two a week. Additionally, there are many online modules that have been created to support a flip-the-classroom style of instruction. To further help students develop their ability to apply basic science concepts to clinical cases, Vet Cases were developed. These are released weekly and coincide with the material the students are learning. They are old exams that were converted into modules the students can work through on their own time. They support content application and are another nice way for us to communicate expectations and the dreaded question “how deep do I need to go into this topic?”. The Vet Cases also provide a safety net for us to make sure students have some exposure to all major learning objectives for the week. That being said – they should not be relied on as a sole resource!

In addition to the tutor guide, are there other supports for tutors?

Tutor Mentoring
Kelly Lyboldt is currently the Foundation Course III Course Leader and a formal mentor for all new tutors. If you are having any issues or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to her. If students inquire about general course structure, if they can take a test at a later date etc please ask the students to email the course leader. This just helps with continuity and lets the course leader know if there is a larger problem at hand sooner rather than later.

Tutor Preparation Sessions (aka Tutor Prep)
The Thursday before each case at 1pm all tutors will come together for a tutor prep session. Prior to these sessions materials will be emailed to you for your review – and we will review them and answer questions during the in-person sessions. This is a time where major learning objectives for the week will be reviewed. How they can be extracted from the case and also we will review any diagnostic findings. We also discuss how group dynamics are going, if there are any students we are concerned about etc. It is a time for questions to be asked and generally someone in the group knows the answer! 

What does a tutor do?

Glad you asked! Here is a key principle: a tutor is a facilitator of learning NOT an instructor.

Tutors:
•Make sure students follow the process to maximize benefits of PBL
• Manage interpersonal challenges (ranging from subtle to dramatic)
• Support group processing
• Ensure students stay within course boundaries and reach appropriate level of depth
• Promote the use of effective learning methods and resources (help identify)
• Encourage students to question their understanding and push themselves
• Empower students to become independent learners
• The tutor is not there to provide content expertise or instruction

What happens in the tutor room? How do we start a case?

We will talk a lot about getting to know your group and discussing with them how they’d like to function during the tutor training session itself. Once all that is set and the group is ready to begin the first case – you, the tutor, will handout page 1 of the case.

A student in the group will read this aloud. Following that another student will get up to the white board and write the headers for four lists on the board. These include
•	Facts
•	Problems
•	Mechanisms
•	Plan

•	Some groups will put up a fifth called Learning Objectives

The students as a group will then populate the lists and identify learning objectives (content they need/want to learn to understand the physiology, pathophysiology, clinical pathology, pharmacology or anatomic pathology of the case).  This is a time where you can ask guiding questions related to helping them identify learning objectives/push them to go deeper into the material.

Learning objectives most often arise when discussing the mechanisms list and plan list.
Tasks will drive development of SOME learning objectives but are NOT all encompassing.

Once the first page has been thoroughly discussed in the manner above, you hand out the second page or, when appropriate, students may ask for a piece of data like a complete blood count or chemistry panel. 

Can you please elaborate a little bit? What belongs under each list heading?

Sure thing! 
Facts: students list all of the facts on a given case page

Problems: Students list all the problems for a given case. For example, the patient’s age and sex might be included in the facts list but would not be included in the problems list. This process helps develop clinical reasoning by asking students to differentiate the facts from the problems and identify which problem(s) will help guide their diagnostic and treatment plan.

Mechanisms: Once students have identified the problems (usually something from the patient’s history like vomiting or a finding on physical exam such as tacky mucous membranes) they need to start asking questions like what at the physiologic level could be “broken” to cause this clinical problem? Another way to word this is, what are some pathophysiologic mechanisms that could cause a clinical sign or physical exam finding.

This is the heart of the conversation that will likely lead to development of the most learning objectives. They will likely recall the structure of an organ system (gross and cellular level) but they may not yet know how it functions under normal conditions to maintain homeostasis.

Plan: After discussing some possible pathophysiologic mechanism students will need to think about what diagnostics/treatments they want to pursue to rule-in or rule-out or treat the underlying pathophysiology.
- this category highlights clinical pathology and reinforces physiology
- also supports pharmacology

Also, as a tutor don’t just let the students say they want a chemistry panel. Make sure to ask them why they want the chemistry panel. What are they looking for? How will this help them better understand what might be going on with the patient? Clients are going to want to know this information before spending their hard-earned money on a test and sometimes clients won’t have money to spend so students are going to need to identify which diagnostics are going to be the most informative.

It looks like there are about 3 days dedicated to each case. Do we do the same thing every day?

Day 1 will look a lot like what was described above. Students will start the case, get through a couple of pages as well as some data. This should drive development of most of the learning objectives for the case. 

Day 2 will be different in that about half of the session will be spent reviewing learning objectives from the previous day as a group. The second half of this day looks much like the first until the case is completed.

Day 3 will be spent reviewing any new learning objectives from day 2 and possibly revisiting any from day 1. The second half of this session will be spent developing an assimilation map.

What is an assimilation map?

This is a map the group will develop together to link all of the patient’s presenting problems and clinical signs to the underlying pathophysiology, clinical data and pharmacology. It is an activity pursued in an effort to help them integrate these concepts, identify any weaknesses and as a tutor, we can often identify misconceptions during the conversations that arise while students are discussing how to build the map. A new module has been developed to provide some instruction on the goals of assimilation mapping, where to begin and why this activity is important for their learning. That module can be found here and you are welcome to review it:

Are there any tutor Do’s and Don’ts I should know about?

First off, does do’s have an apostrophe or not? This seems controversial – so I may have just committed a don’t.

The first two are most important!
• Don’t share any aspects of the tutor guide, which includes the guide itself
• Don’t share case objectives that are given to you in the tutor guide
•	Sharing the tutor guide and case objectives would significantly detract from the clinical reasoning skills we are trying to develop and it would completely undermine the problem-based learning model

• Don’t bring resources to distribute to your tutor group
•	If you have a resource you’d like to share, give it to the course leader. The course leader will bring to CDG and we will consider posting the resource on Canvas for all students to access
• Don’t answer general questions about the course or give permissions to miss assessments etc.
•	Please have the student inquire with the course leader regarding these issues.  We like to maintain consistency to be fair. As well, tutoring is your role – you do not need to take on any more responsibility! 
• Do feel comfortable with long moments of silence
• One ground rule to have the group set is how tutor group absences will be handled. 
•	It is not an expectation for you to get materials to absent student or meet
with them outside of tutor group hours
•	As well, this is not a remote course so zooming during tutor group is not allowed unless permissions come from student disability services. If a student is going to miss more than one session, please have them reach out to the course leader.
•    Please let me know if a student has missed a session.
•	Absence should be rare – in-person attendance and active engagement is required


Clinical Reasoning Conceptual Framework for PBL
This is the basic model we have presented to the first-year class to introduce them to major concepts in clinical reasoning. The first figure defines the overall framework. The second figure adds details related to each category in the framework. The third figure relates the framework to PBL and indicates what students have already been introduced to. Terms are defined on subsequent pages. These diagrams will be discussed during tutor training.

What tutors can do to help students develop clinical reasoning abilities through the PBL
This page provides ideas and questions tutors can use to support the development of clinical reasoning abilities in their students. A detailed explanation of the clinical reasoning terms and concepts is provided on the following pages. Similar information will be shared with the students, so they will also be familiar with the terms and concepts. As with other course content, it is not the tutor’s responsibility to teach these concepts. However, by asking certain questions and pushing students to elaborate, provide details and explain their reasoning, you can help them develop their clinical reasoning abilities. In each of the 4 PBL processes below, bullets indicate ideas for how tutors can promote the development of clinical reasoning while also supporting students in learning course content.
We hope you will experiment a bit with integrating these concepts where they naturally arise from the case and where they support student learning. We will be interested in hearing from tutors what went well and what was difficult for tutors and/or students so we can evolve this effort over time.
1. Converting FACTS to a PROBLEM LIST
• Encourage students to use semantic transformation to convert lay language and raw diagnostic data into concise medical terminology.
• Encourage students to use semantic qualifiers to characterize clinical problems in ways that facilitate the identification and discrimination of possible pathophysiological mechanisms (onset, progression, severity, location, quality, etc.)
2. Generating the MECHANISMS list
Basic Process: Students use non-analytic and analytic reasoning to generate hypotheses about possible pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the patient’s presentation and problems
• First allow students to generate hypotheses about pathophysiological mechanisms intuitively, in an unstructured way, based on their previous experiences with similar cases (i.e. non-analytic reasoning)
• Then, suggest that students identify a systematic approach to support generation of a more comprehensive list of possible mechanisms (i.e. analytic reasoning)
o Note: this could lead students to raise the topic of diagnostic frameworks and how they are used
• Optional - Encourage students to reflect on the differences between and the pros and cons of the analytical and non-analytical reasoning approaches and the on the value of diagnostic frameworks.
3. Determining the PLAN
• The plan is designed to prioritize or eliminate hypotheses and to treat the patient. If a plan is suggested before mechanisms are proposed, ask students what implicit hypotheses prompted the plan.
• Encourage students to be specific in their plan – don’t just list ‘PE’ or ‘Chemistry panel’, specify exactly what tests they want to run.
• Ask students to explain why they are requesting a specific diagnostic test or treatment – how does the plan help them prioritize mechanisms or manage the patient’s problem?
4. Generating a CONCISE CASE SUMMARY
Promotes students’ ability to identify and synthesize key information, critical steps in the development of a problem representation
• Acknowledge the challenge of determining what information can be eliminated and how to consolidate multiple findings into a single concept like a syndrome
• Remind students that there is not a single correct answer.
• Compare and contrast different summaries :
o What information did students eliminate and why?
o What are the advantages and disadvantages of eliminating information?
o How and why did students synthesize multiple bits of info into single concepts?

Clinical Reasoning Terms and Definitions
Many of the terms below have been introduced to the students in Block I and Neuroanatomy. Terms that will be newly introduced to students in Block III are Diagnostic Framework and Problem Representation. The definitions of these terms as they apply in a clinical context are provided below. An explanation of how these concepts can be specifically applied in Block III is provided on the previous page.
Semantic Transformation
• Replaces lay language and detailed diagnostic data with standardized medical terminology
o example: “dragging the pelvic limbs and hyper-reflexia” becomes “spastic paraplegia”
o example: “potassium of 2.9 mEq/L” becomes “hypokalemia”
• Replaces a group of clinical signs with the relevant syndrome
o example: “ptosis, enophthalmos, and miosis” becomes “Horner’s Syndrome”
o example: “azotemia, isosthenuria, small irregular kidneys” becomes “chronic renal disease”
• Semantic Transformation promotes a clinical understanding of a situation and standardizes language to reduce cognitive load and facilitate pattern recognition
Semantic Qualifiers
• Standardized, often paired/opposing, qualitative descriptors of a clinical presentation
• Describe (or qualify) aspects of a clinical presentation including time course (duration, onset, temporal pattern) severity, location, quality, provoking/palliating factors
• Can be used to compare and contrast, and thereby weigh the probability of differential diagnoses
• Examples
o sharp/dull
o acute/subacute/chronic
o abrupt/gradual
o painful/non-painful
o productive/nonproductive
o localized/multifocal/diffuse
o constant/intermittent/episodic
o stable/waxing-and-waning/progressive
o proximal/distal
o exertional/non-exertional
Written by Marnie FitzMaurice and Jonathan Wood in consultation with Kelly Lyboldt, Block III Course Leader (2024)
Dual Processing Theory
Clinical decision-making relies on 2 types of cognitive processes, analytic and non-analytic reasoning, that occur in parallel. By understanding these processes and recognizing the relative strengths and weakness of each, students become better able to regulate their own reasoning processes to improve their clinical decision making.
Non-analytic reasoning
• Fast, intuitive, unconscious generation of clinical hypotheses and decisions
• Occurs when clinical cues automatically and unconsciously activate a distributed neural network encoding relevant clinical information
• Relies on pattern recognition based on organized knowledge structures that form as a result of extensive experience
• Pros: intuitive, fast, efficient, often accurate in experienced clinicians
• Cons: subject to bias and blindness to error; prone to error in novices who lack extensive experience
• Experts typically rely first on non-analytical reasoning, and use analytic reasoning to validate conclusions, mitigate biases, manage situational challenges, and resolve knowledge gaps
• Novices can develop their non-analytic reasoning through deliberate practice. This involves intuitively generating hypotheses, checking them with a systematic analytical approach, and reflecting on what viable hypotheses they missed, why they might have missed them, and how they can remember them in the future. This learning will occur over time based on experience, but deliberate practice can accelerate the learning process.
Analytic Reasoning
• Involves a systematic, deliberate approach to a clinical problem through methodical gathering and evaluation of information
• Pros: rational, deliberate, reliable, safe
• Cons: slow and resource intensive – not sustainable as a regular approach in clinical practice
• Novices rely heavily on analytic reasoning as they lack or have poorly developed knowledge structures
• Experienced clinicians rely on analytic reasoning when 1) confronted with an unfamiliar or atypical case, 2) the stakes are high and decisions need to be double-checked, 3) concerns about bias prompt a review of clinical decisions
• Repetition of analytic reasoning in response to similar patient presentations builds organized knowledge structures (i.e. Illness Scripts and Diagnostic Frameworks) that support non-analytic reasoning in subsequent cases
Hypothesis Generation
• As a clinician is presented with patient information, they use analytic and non-analytic reasoning to generate hypotheses about the cause(s) of their patient’s problems. These hypotheses evolve as additional information is acquired until a diagnosis is determined or the clinician has enough information to treat the patient.
• Hypotheses may include body systems, regions or organs, pathophysiological mechanisms, syndromes, specific diseases or disease agents, etc. that could underlie the patient’s presentation
• Hypotheses will dictate decisions to gather additional information with the goal of refining the list of hypotheses and prioritizing the most likely hypotheses (i.e. hypotheses drive the plan in PBL).
In Block III, students generate hypotheses based on the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the patient’s clinical problems
Written by Marnie FitzMaurice and Jonathan Wood in consultation with Kelly Lyboldt, Block III Course Leader (2024)
Diagnostic Frameworks (new to students in Block III)
• Efficient, systematic approaches to clinical problems that help a clinician 1) generate diagnostic hypotheses and 2) select diagnostic investigations
• “Chunk” diagnoses in intuitive ways to facilitate recall, thereby reducing the chance of missing an important differential diagnosis
• Expert frameworks will be strategically organized to guide an efficient diagnostic process, minimizing the number of diagnostic tests required and reducing unnecessary diagnostic testing
• Simple example: approach to generating and investigating causes of azotemia – diagnoses are “chunked” into 3 categories, each of which indicates a few simple tests the results of which allow prioritization of the categories:
o Prerenal (check mucous membranes, skin turgor, PCV/TS)
o Renal (palpate kidneys, check USG)
o Post-renal (palpate bladder)
• Over time and based on experience, clinicians often develop more contextualized and efficient diagnostic frameworks, for example, frameworks based on early versus later clinical findings rather than pathophysiological mechanisms. However, they may fall back on more analytically organized framework when they are stumped.
• In Block III tutor group, students will make connections between clinical problems and patho-physiological mechanisms, developing a foundation for diagnostic frameworks and analytic reasoning.
Problem Representation (new to students in Block III)
• A concise (1-2 sentence) description of the patient’s presentation that includes information most relevant to diagnosing and managing the current concerns
• Uses medical terminology (semantic transformation and semantic qualifiers)
• Facilitates the generation of differential diagnoses by activating illness scripts and focusing analytic reasoning efforts, thereby influencing the acquisition of subsequent information
• Cognitive theory
o reduces cognitive load by eliminating distractors and focusing on most relevant information
o translation into standardized medical terminology facilitates cuing and activation of illness scripts
• Components of the Problem Representation
o Who is the patient? (highly relevant signalment, medical history and epidemiological risk factors)
o What is the time course of the problem? (onset, duration, pattern)
o What are the key features of the clinical presentation? (key examination and diagnostic findings)
• Example:
o Raw information: Patient is an unknown-age spayed female Pitbull mix adopted 8 years ago from a shelter. She had been a healthy dog but began throwing up 2 days ago. She has vomited 7-8 times a day. It started out as food but now is just yellow colored liquid. She won’t eat anything and had some bloody diarrhea. She is just lying around the house and hasn’t wanted to play with toys. Her owners say she did get into the garbage a few days before this started. She has a capillary refill time of 3 seconds, a heart rate of 144 bpm with synchronous but thready pulses. She is panting and painful on cranial abdominal palpation. Frank blood mixed with liquid stool was found on digital rectal exam.
o Problem representation: A senior spayed female Pitbull mix with acute abdomen and hypovolemic shock following dietary indiscretion.
• In Block III, a task has been added to each case asking students to practice generating concise case summaries. They are not expected to achieve true Problem Representations, but will practice identifying key information, eliminating distracting information, converting information into medical terminology and combining multiple findings into single concepts such as syndromes.

The Role of Problem-based Learning in the DVM Curriculum
Why does Cornell u.lize problem-based learning?
In problem-based learning (PBL), students work in small groups using a clinical “tutor case” as a
springboard for exploring course material. Faculty, referred to as tutors, serve as facilitators,
guiding the students’ learning. However, students within the tutor group should be the drivers
of their educaHon, idenHfying learning opportuniHes, independently researching these topics,
and sharing their knowledge with their peers in the group to check for shared understanding. In
this way, PBL holds students accountable for independent mastery of the material, while also
supporHng the development of communicaHon, collaboraHon and professionalism skills that are
an essenHal component of preparing for a career in veterinary medicine.
Some of the benefits of PBL documented through educaHonal research include:
• SHmulates student curiosity for the subject maMer
• Sustains moHvaHon to learn foundaHonal scienHfic knowledge by making explicit its
clinical relevance
• AcHvates prior knowledge to allow students to build on exisHng frameworks
• Promotes deep-learning and long-term retenHon of the material
• Supports integraHon and applicaHon of the material
• Fosters professional skills and aOtudes important throughout the students’ educaHon
and in the workplace
• Supports the development of life-long, self-regulated learning skills
How does PBL support competency-based veterinary educa.on?
The DVM program at Cornell is competency-based, with a competency framework, developed
by college faculty, used to design, deliver and monitor the efficacy of the curriculum. At the
course-level, these competencies support curriculum coherence, where each course plays a role
in helping ensure students achieve the intended program outcomes.
The curriculum framework consists of 9 overarching domains of competency. Beneath these
domains, are sets of competencies and sub-competencies that provide more detailed guidance
on the knowledge, skills, and aMributes expected of graduates of our program. Tutors play an
important role in fostering student development of professional skills including criHcal
reasoning and problem solving, communicaHon, collaboraHon, and professionalism. Tutors
should therefore familiarize themselves with the competency framework, available online here,
to help prepare them for their role.
PBL serves an essenHal funcHon in our curriculum, preparing graduates to be competent and
confident veterinary professionals on day one of pracHce. The small group, case-based format
of PBL has the potenHal to foster the following:

Professionalism
• PracHce professional behavior and conduct in the tutor group
• Being responsible to the team
• PracHce Hme management
• Balance studies with aMending to personal well-being
• Building resilience
CommunicaHon
• Progress and learning depends heavily on effecHve communicaHon with peers
• Engagement, respect, conflict resoluHon, learning how to agreeably disagree
• Group processing and tutor feedback provide opportuniHes to pracHce calibraHon of
study approaches
CollaboraHon
• Learn how to leverage team diversity as the group pools its knowledge and experience
• Development of skills to support effecHve teamwork
• PracHce balancing parHcipaHon across the group
• PracHce producHve mediaHon of conflicts
• PracHce inclusivity by incorporaHng other’s ideas and perspecHves
• Respond to construcHve feedback
Evidence-based pracHces
• Recognize limits of one’s own knowledge
• Construct relevant quesHons
• Locate relevant informaHon
• Apply informaHon to solve problems
PBL also promotes the integraHon of knowledge and skills across disciplines and courses, a key
apHtude needed by veterinarians who must apply knowledge to real world cases and problems.
Finally, PBL helps students strengthen their self-regulated learning skills. The cyclical process of
seOng learning goals, acHvely construcHng learning plans, monitoring learning outcomes and
adjusHng learning approaches are all criHcal skills for life-long learning in the veterinary medical
profession.
How can tutors foster student development of professional competencies?
PBL tutoring is an acquired skill that requires pracHce, feedback, and adjustment. Understanding
the role of the tutor is the first step in the journey to becoming an effecHve tutor. Tutors serve
as facilitators of student’s learning and must learn how to provide the appropriate amount of
guidance and structure to the tutor group sessions, without slipping into the role of instructor.
Too much intervenHon by a tutor can interfere with the group’s ownership of the learning
process. Too liMle intervenHon can lead to inefficient and unproducHve tutor group sessions. As

a new tutor, you may be learning a set of coaching and facilitaHon skills that are new to you. Be
paHent with yourself and understand that it may take a liMle Hme for you to become
comfortable and confident in your new role.
Below are few Hps to help your tutor group get the most out of their tutor group sessions while
developing their professional skills under your guidance.
