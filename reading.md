INTRODUCTION
An outbreak of diarrheal disease in a group of piglets is the basis for exploration of the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract. The focus of the case is motility, digestion, absorption, and secretion of the small and large intestine. Presence of enterotoxigenic E. coli should encourage students to consider gut function down to the molecular level.
 
CLINICAL SUMMARY
case: Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)

A small cohort of gilts is purchased in order to increase the size of a breeding herd. An outbreak of severe diarrhea is taking the lives of nearly every neonatal piglet. The diagnostic report returned after necropsy of several specimens reveals that the problem is based in the presence of an enterotoxigenic E. coli. Changes in key management practices along with a vaccine have a major impact on the disease outbreak.
 
CASE OUTLINE

Page	Date	Scenario	Topics


1		30 sows; 6 gilts; all farrowing; gilts’ pigs seem to be dying of diarrheal
disease	gut morphology: gross, histologic; digestion/absorption of major nutrient classes; GI secretions; diarrhea;
2		necropsy one pig	dehydration; shock; neural basis of motility; basis of pathogenicity of E. coli; diarrhea;
3		vaccination strategy	secretory mechanisms; dehydration; colostral antibody absorption; epithelial tissue transport
 
CASE OBJECTIVES
1.	Provide an overview of the organization and function of the alimentary system.
2.	Describe the epithelial lining of the various parts of the alimentary tract, relating the histology to specializations in function.
3.	Illustrate the vascular supply and innervation of the GI tract.
4.	Explain the basis for GI motility and smooth muscle tone, from the subcellular to the gross level. Compare and contrast with cardiac and skeletal muscle.
5.	Compare and contrast the role of the enteric nervous system and the autonomic nervous systems in regulating GI function.
6.	Describe the role of each segment of the GI tract in food processing.
7.	Identify the nature of GI secretions. Why are these secretions needed; how and where are they manufactured; what hormones are involved; what drugs are used to modulate them?
8.	Explain the secretion, circulation, regulation, and absorption of water and electrolytes in the GI tract. Relate them to clinical signs related to diseases of each of the different segments of the GI tract.
9.	Describe how each of the major nutrient components of food is digested and absorbed. What is the fate of nutrients that are not adequately digested?
 
BIG IDEAS
•	The body comprises a group of interacting, interrelated, and interdependent systems that form a complex and unified whole. Diagnosis and treatment must take these interactions and interdependencies into account. Many diseases have multi‐system effects.
•	Formulating a therapeutic plan requires a critical determination of what the patient needs.
•	Function depends on structure at all levels, from molecules to organisms. Specialized structures produce specialized functions.
•	Organs respond to injury, but can fail. Cells respond to injury, but can die.
•	Pathology results when normal physiology "breaks." Diagnosis, then, requires knowing "normal" and determining what's "broken."
•	Pathogenesis: "telling a story" about the emergence of a patient’s clinical presentation.
 
PACING
This case is designed to be completed in three 2‐hour sessions. The first session (page 1 & 2) will include a discussion about the nature of diarrhea, gut motility and its regulation, absorption, and secretion. Concepts relating to fluid compartments will be revisited. It works well if data pages are distributed to students at the end of the session, allowing students to investigate mechanisms of diarrhea associated with the causitive organism.
Session two reviews learning issues from the previous sesssion and continues the discussion about gut function, especially in light of diagnostics associated with E. coli. Additional discussion should include the pathologies associated with diarrhea, fluid compartments, and hypovolemic shock. Page 3 can be covered at this time.
Students should utilize their time during session three to summarize their previous discussions about gut morphology and function, and to be sure that they understand the major learning issues centered around motility, digestion, absorption, secretion, and regulation.

You are visiting Connie and Stef Jorgensen's farm this morning. In addition to thirty older sows, they have six other animals, purchased as bred gilts at the local sale barn. Farrowing started about a week ago.
The building in which the sows are farrowing is a new pole barn. The farrowing crates are homemade and wooden. They appear to be too long and have solid floors. Many of the one‐ and two‐day‐old piglets are squirting a yellowish diarrhea. The sows seem to have plenty of milk and most of their little piglets are nursing. The piglets from the gilts, on the other hand, are nursing but appear to be a little hungry and underweight. They have lost 27 piglets so far, mostly from the six gilts. The Jorgensens had been using gentamicin in every piglet until recently when the gentamicin seemed not to be effective.




















TASKS
Identify: the 3 sections of the small intestine; the 3 sections of the large intestine; 4 layers of the GI tract; 3 types of epithelial cells in the small intestine.
Follow the path and fate of three constituents of sow’s milk from their initial consumption until they are combusted for energy in a liver cell: carbohydrate (e.g., lactose); protein (e.g., glycine); lipid (e.g., linoleic acid).
What are the pathophysiological differentials for the diarrhea?
 
WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE DISCUSSING

•	Problem list:
o	myriad management issues, which we won't pursue
o	diarrhea
•	Improve vocabulary as it relates to pig production.
•	Review histology of the intestine
•	Definition and pathophysiology of diarrhea
•	Mechanisms of digestion and absorption
•	gut histology and motility
•	Function depends on structure at all levels, from molecules to organisms. Specialized structures produce specialized functions.
•	Pathology results when normal physiology "breaks." Diagnosis, then, requires knowing "normal" and determining what's "broken."
 
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Based on the facilities and management practices of this farm, it seems clear the Jorgensen’s are relative neophytes at this business. Management‐wise, there are a number of things they could do to improve their current predicament, although not right away.
First, introducing new gilts onto this farm without attempting to immunize them is a mistake. The gilts, naïve to the bacteria on this farm, will not develop relevant colostral immunity in time and, therefore, their offspring will be unprotected from pathogenic bacteria in the environment as neonates.
Second, wooden crates with solid floors are nearly impossible to sanitize. Metal or vinyl‐covered metal works much better for this purpose. Further, slatted floors allow feces to pass through, preventing a build‐ up of a bacterial load within the crate.
Third, the long crates allow the sows to move around too much, spreading their feces and unnecessarily exposing their pigs to large numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
Fourth, although this is somewhat conjecture, the pole barn may not be an ideal facility for farrowing pigs. Unless designed correctly, many of these buildings are either drafty or difficult to heat/cool. Pigs that are too cool have lowered resistance to enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) infection, largely because of the reduced gastrointestinal motility. Sows that are too hot will purposely spread liquids (usually feces) around in the crate as a cooling mechanism. This serves, again, to spread bacteria over a larger area.
Fifth, indiscriminate use of gentamicin is bound to fail because of bacterial resistance.
The pigs are dying from the physiologic consequences of diarrhea: metabolic acidosis, dehydration, and cardiovascular collapse. At this point in the case, insufficient information is available to discern the definitive cause of the diarrhea, although E. coli is a very common causative agent. The organism is probably persistent on this farm and the old sows have developed an immunity, which they will pass on to their pigs via colostrum. However, the gilts are naïve to this strain and, therefore, will not pass immunity to their piglets.

•	Students will be studying liver and pancreas next fall (IIIb), at which time they will learn about pancreatic and hepatic function. Emphasis of the current case is on digestive, secretory, and absorptive functions of the mouth, stomach, and intestines without regard to the extra‐ intestinal source of enzymes/bile acids.

Keep in mind that students will be studying liver and pancreas during Block IIIb in the fall, at which time they will learn about pancreatic and hepatic function. Emphasis of the current task is on digestive and absorptive functions of the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Boron provides very nice coverage of this topic, including figures that illustrate and summarize basic mechanisms.
What are the pathophysiological differentials for the diarrhea?
Not knowing the exact inciting cause at this point infuses some ambiguity into our thinking. This should lead to a more robust discussion of the causes of diarrhea that goes beyond the specific mechanisms at work in this case. There are several ways to classify diarrhea. One common scheme lists five causes of diarrhea (Kumar, Abbas, et al. 2005):
a.secretory b.osmotic c.exudative d.malabsorptive e.deranged motility

In secretory diarrhea, there is a net excess of secretion over absorption by an intact mucosal epithelium. This is brought about by molecular interactions that specifically interfere with ion pumps on the villous and crypt enterocyte cell membranes, via G‐protein coupled receptors and the production of cyclic nucleotide second messengers. On villous enterocytes the effect is shut‐down of sodium chloride co‐
 
transport at the luminal cell membrane, reducing passive water resorption. Simultaneously in crypt cells there is continuous activation of the chloride pump and active sodium chloride secretion is promoted, with resultant passive effusion of water. The net effect is an increased solute and water load in the lumen. Hypersecretion is classically induced by a number of bacterial exotoxins, but it may be mediated by various eicosanoids, amines, and cytokines.
Osmotic diarrhea results from the trapping of water in the lumen by a high concentration of osmotically active molecules. Secretory, exudative, and malabsorptive diarrheas are, fundamentally, osmotic diarrheas. However, “osmotic diarrhea” is listed as a separate cause since agents such as lactulose or magnesium sulfate can induce a diarrhea that does not involve secretory, exudative, or malabsorptive mechanisms.
Exudative diarrhea results from injury to the mucosa. It can also be produced when chemical mediators of the inflammatory process in the mucosa increase the permeability of mucosal blood vessels.
Malabsorptive diarrhea results from the osmotic effect of particles of digested food that are not absorbed across the gut epithelium. These particles remain in the lumen of the gut, retain water, and generate diarrhea.
Permeability diarrhea is also promoted by conditions causing edema of the lamina propria of the mucosa, according to an imbalance of Starling’s forces as they apply in any tissue. Thus, increased venous hydrostatic pressure, reduced plasma oncotic pressure, or lymphatic obstruction may be involved. Under such conditions, there is net movement of water and solutes from the extracellular space to the lumen.

Deranged motility may play a role in some circumstances. When it occurs, the transit of luminal contents is too rapid for effective regulation of fecal water content.

The precise contents of this list might vary from text to text, but this is the list we would like students to learn. It is also the list that Dr. Duhamel includes in his lecture on Diarrhea.

Then you notice a little piglet lying really still in one of the farrowing crates housing a gilt. Picking it up, you conclude that it must have died while you were visiting with the Jorgensens; it is not yet in rigor. There is some pale‐yellowish diarrhea staining the perineum.
You do a quick necropsy of the piglet on the tailgate of your truck. The piglet's ears and legs feel cooler than the trunk, his mouth is dry, and his eyes are sunk in a little. There is a stomach full of milk but no other gross abnormalities. You plan to submit a couple of live, affected piglets to the Diagnostic Laboratory.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Because of their small size and the virulence of the pathogenic organisms, affected piglets will die within a very short time frame. A full stomach indicates that appetite is good but that the effects of the disease are acute. The diarrhea is pale presumably because gut contents are moving so quickly through the GI tract that there is insufficient time for conversion of constituents of bile (bilirubin) to stercobilin and urobilin.
Skin turgor is not a useful tool for the assessment of hydration in pigs as it is in other species. However, it is noted that the mouth is dry and the eyes are sunken. With dehydration, blood volume is reduced and blood flow is diverted from the extremities to the core. Appendages (limbs, ears, tail) will be cool due to the intense vasoconstriction that serves to redirect blood flow to maintain effective circulating volume and reduce heat loss.
The “tissue” of choice for submission to a diagnostic laboratory is a live pig. This will insure that opportunistic organisms do not confuse the picture. Certain strains of non‐pathogenic E. coli normally inhabit the gut and these may numerically overwhelm pathogenic strains in a dead pig (due to the fact that the gut stops moving) OR small numbers of pathogenic strains that were not present in high enough numbers to cause disease in life may multiply post‐mortem. In either case, diagnostic laboratories request that the squeal accompany the pig if at all possible.
A wide variety of bacterial species are represented in the GI tract, including Streptococci, coliforms, Corynebacteria, Clostridia, and many others. Below the duodenum, the number of resident bacteria increases progressively. The number found in the duodenum, jejunum, and upper ileum, is relatively small. Adhesion of the specific strain of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) found in this case within the small intestine requires the presence of extracellular proteinaceous appendages called fimbriae or pili. These appendages are highly host specific. ETEC uses one or more fimbrial antigens labeled F4, F5, F6, or F41. Fimbrial adhesions mediate attachment of the E. coli to specific receptors on mucosal epithelial cells. F4 (present in this case) tends to colonize the jejunum and ileum. ETEC produce enterotoxins that change water and electrolyte flux and may lead to diarrhea if the excess fluid from the small intestine is not absorbed in sufficient quantities in the large intestine.
While ETEC infections are not generally associated with any morphological lesion, the heat stable toxin St‐b has been shown to induce some villous atrophy in pig intestinal gut loops. The exact mechanism is not known but it certainly would not be as marked as in other causes of atrophy, such as TGE.
Because ETEC induces a biochemical rather than a morphological lesion, it is possible for gross signs of disease to be absent at necropsy.
 
TASKS

Task 1 ‐ What, exactly, is killing these pigs?
To answer “euthanasia solution at the Diagnostic Lab” is correct but sassy. It may be a “knee‐jerk” or naïve response for students to suggest that the pigs are dying of an infection or a bacterial toxin, because we all “know” that diarrhea is caused by infections of one sort or another. Students may want to defer answering this Task until they have come to understand the underlying mechanism of the diarrhea in this case.
We know that the toxin associated with ETEC binds to an enterocyte receptor. There is no massive inflammatory response and no morphologic changes (aside from some possible villous atrophy). Death is a direct consequence of fluid loss. At work is a pathology of the physiology, not of the anatomy. Now it is left to discuss the consequences of this fact.
a.	We don’t know the exact osmotic composition of the diarrhea, but it would be reasonable to assume that the diarrhea has resulted in an isotonic fluid loss. This leads to extracellular volume depletion, contraction of the extracellular fluid volume, and decreased plasma (blood) volume. Being an isotonic fluid loss, the volume of the intracellular space is unaffected. Decreased water in the ISF is detectable as decreased skin turgor (difficult to evaluate in the pig) and sunken eyes (easy to evaluate). Loss of blood volume manifests as cool extremities due to potent vasoconstriction and, because of decreased cardiac output, prolonged CRT and lower blood pressure.
b.	Poor perfusion stemming from decreased blood volume leads to an increase in anaerobic metabolism and production of lactic acid, resulting in a metabolic acidosis. Loss of large quantities of HCO3‐ via the feces also contributes to the acidosis. When severe, acidosis can produce dysrhythmias and reduced contractility, exacerbating the poor cardiac output that already exists owing to the low blood volume.
c.	Decreased cardiac output will eventually affect brain function. Depression, including respiratory depression, will be in evidence. Because it is depressed, the respiratory system, rather than compensating for the acidosis, is contributing to the acidosis and its consequences. As blood volume and blood pressure continue to decline, perfusion of the brain and heart will be insufficient to support even minimal function.
Although arterial blood gas analysis would never be performed under circumstances such as those described in this case, it would be worthwhile for students to predict the acid‐base status of the piglets. A potential treatment plan is concealed in the analysis of the pathologic consequences of the diarrhea. Isotonic fluid loss is the main problem. Therefore, replacing isotonic fluid quickly and efficiently will provide effective treatment. Since absorptive functions are minimally affected, a Na+/glucose/amino acid mixture in water that takes advantage of multiple epithelial transporters is the treatment of choice. Learning topic: shock, dehydration
Task 2 ‐ Explain how the etiologic agent is affecting these piglets.
“Any cellular or pathologic process that increases intracellular cAMP concentration results in activation of PKA, which phosphorylates the regulatory domain of CFTR. This phosphorylation results in opening of the CFTR, enhancing Cl‐ secretion. Examples of important mediators or toxins that increase cAMP and cause Cl‐ secretion are pro‐inflammatory prostanoids, such as PGE2, and pathogenic bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat‐labile enterotoxins.”
 
 

From: Moeser AJ, Blikslager AT. Mechanisms of porcine diarrheal disease. J Am Vet Med Assoc 231: 56-67, 2007.

LT-II binds a ganglioside receptor on epithelial cell surfaces, activating adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP and activation of PKA, which phosphorylates the CFTR. The net result is opening of the CFTR, greatly enhancing Cl- (and water) secretion.
The action of STb is not understood as well, but STb is thought to stimulate secretion by activating enteric nerves, stimulating release of 5HT and PGE2. This, in turn, activates a neural secretory reflex arc via release of secretory stimuli, mainly VIP, which attach to receptors on both villus and crypt enterocytes, activating adenylyl cyclase and inducing cAMP-mediated alterations of ion transport (inhibition of absorption in villus cells and stimulation of secretion in crypt cells).
Task 3 ‐ Tissue sections:
What histologic structures are necessary for normal function of the gut?
The gut needs: epithelial cells with intact tight junctions (and polarity) and basement membrane; a functional enteric nervous system; lacteals and capillaries; enteroendocrine cells. Crypts and villi should be evident. At a more ultrastructural level, (some) epithelial cells need a brush border and an unstirred water layer with an appropriate composition. Cells should have normal absorptive and secretory mechanisms (biochemical and structural).
 
Describe the normal and abnormal features in the tissue sections.
These are morphologically normal tissue sections.
Relate your observations to the diarrhea.
There are no histologic lesions. The significant lesions in this case are entirely biochemical.

TASKS

Gastrointestinal viruses in various species typically either destroy villous epithelial cells (e.g., rotavirus in pigs) or destroy crypt epithelium (e.g., parvovirus in dogs). For these two types of viruses and for the E. coli in this case, predict a) clinical signs, b) cause of the diarrhea, c) course of the disease, and d) relative mortality risk.

An extensive appreciation of the viruses or associated diseases is not necessary to undertake this task. Students must only recognize the effects that the viruses have on specific cell types (given in the task) and be able to deduce the subsequent consequences. (Note: some of the information below is for tutor background and is not necessarily required for students to address this task.)

Virus destroying villus tips: (Rotavirus is a good example.)

•	Cause of the diarrhea: Villus epithelial cell function includes both digestion (via brush border enzymes) and absorption of substrate. As villus cells are lost, a maldigestion/malabsorption diarrhea develops that is profuse.
•	Clinical signs: Clinical signs are similar to those in the present case and are directly attributable to malnutrition and fluid loss associated with marked villous atrophy: malnutrition, dehydration, weakness, depression, and, potentially, death.
•	Course of the disease (onset, duration): Onset of clinical signs will be relatively rapid after infection (1-4 days). Duration of the infection is limited, in principle, because epithelial cells infected by virus will be shed and replaced through normal mechanisms over the next 2-3 days.
•	Relative mortality risk: Mortality risk is determined by the resources available to the patient (e.g., body fat reserves) and the level of medical intervention. Because of their small size and low energy reserves, once signs develop in little pigs, relatively high mortality rates can be expected. In contrast, older pigs or calves with rotavirus are generally at lower risk of death.

Virus destroying crypts: (Parvovirus in dogs is a good example.)

•	Cause of the diarrhea: Normally, villus epithelial cells turn over at a relatively constant rate, requiring replacement as crypt cells migrate up the villus. When viral disease destroys the crypt epithelium, such replacement of villus epithelium is delayed resulting in denuded villus epithelium. As cells are lost and villous atrophy occurs, a maldigestion/malabsorption diarrhea develops that is profuse
•	Clinical signs: Clinical signs are similar to those in the present case and are directly attributable to malnutrition and fluid loss associated with marked villous atrophy: malnutrition, dehydration, weakness, depression, and potentially, death. Clinical signs may be more severe than in the case of rotavirus infection due to loss of the barrier function of the gut epithelium (both crypts and villi).
•	Course of the disease (onset, duration): Onset of clinical signs will be relatively rapid after infection, but slower than in the case of a virus attacking villus epithelium. Duration
 
of disease will be longer, though, since cells that would normally replace villus cells have been destroyed.
•	Relative mortality risk: Because of the longer course of the disease associated with (i) destruction of the crypts and (ii) loss of the barrier function of the epithelium, recovery is delayed. Due to the prolonged course of the disease and severity of morphologic injury, fluid loss due to diarrhea has a potentially larger impact, increase the risk of mortality.

ETEC:

•	Cause of the diarrhea: The diarrhea is principally secretory in nature and does not involve morphologic changes in gut epithelium.
•	Clinical signs: Clinical signs are consistent largely with fluid loss, rather than malnutrition.
•	Course of the disease (onset, duration): Onset of disease is rapid, with infection usually occurring between the time of birth and first encounter with the teats of the sow. Diarrhea can be observed within 2-3 hours of birth. Duration is generally quite short due the catastrophic effects of the rapid loss of extracellular fluid required for cardiovascular function.
•	Relative mortality risk: Severity of disease and mortality rate are associated with the level of maternal immunity and environmental conditions (e.g., cold environment). Due to severe dehydration, mortality is expected to be high, especially without medical intervention.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
This is the carcass of a 1.1 kg, 3‐day‐old, male, Yorkshire/Landrace piglet in fair body condition with no autolysis. The entire spiral colon is gas‐distended and filled with yellow, watery contents. There are no other gross lesions noted.

GROSS FINDINGS:
Spiral colon: fluid contents


HISTOLOGICAL FINDINGS:

STOMACH: There are multiple foci of neutrophilic infiltration in the glands of the stomach, mostly in the cardia. Occasional glands contain necrotic debris. In the lamina propria there is a diffuse infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. There are normal lymphoid aggregates in the submucosa. In one area of stratified epithelium there is a larger aggregate of neutrophils associated with bacterial colonies.
DUODENUM, JEJUNUM, ILEUM, CECUM, AND COLON: NSL LIVER, LUNG, KIDNEY: NSL

GROSS DIAGNOSIS:
Enteropathy, cause unknown

HISTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
Stomach: Moderate subacute gastritis


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Euthanasia
Colibacillosis, presumptive

Comment: Many heavily encapsulated E.coli were isolated from the GI tract. This fact in conjunction with the lack of any pronounced histologic lesions in the small intestine makes an enterotoxigenic form of E. coli most likely. The relationship of the gastritis to the herd problem of diarrhea is not clear. However, it is thought to be a coincidental lesion.

When the test results arrive from the Diagnostic Laboratory, you call the Jorgensens to discuss an appropriate strategy. You recommend a vaccine to boost the amount of immunoglobulins passed in the gilts' milk. You caution them that a vaccine apart from some management changes will not provide a complete answer. You also advise them against the indiscriminate use of the gentamicin to treat every pig, sick or not.



























TASKS
What do the piglets need if they are going to survive? How can you provide what they need? Explain exactly how your treatment is going to help them.
Pigs are born with very little, if any, immunity to disease but obtain such via the colostrum within hours of birth. Explain why immunoglobulins, which are proteins, that is, targets of digestive processes, can be absorbed into the blood.
 
WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE DISCUSSING

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Maternal vaccination is the most effective way of controlling this disease. Commercial vaccines are available. In the U.S., a common method of vaccinating the gilts involves the culturing of the organism in milk that is subsequently fed to the gilts.(Fairbrother, J. M. and Gyles, C. L., 2006) Immunoglobulins then reach the pigs via the colostrum.
 
TASKS
Task 1 — CV function & shock:
In reality, treating the piglets in this case is out of the question, because the economics of the swine industry won't support high veterinary costs. Estimating the value of a piglet is difficult, but... hogs sell for about $0.75 a pound and piglets weigh 2-3 pounds. The biggest risk in treating the pigs is the likelihood that their growth rates will be stunted, reducing profits significantly.

If we were to treat... These pigs have little or no problem with absorption. Therefore, if we can get enough water into the gut, it will be absorbed, preventing dehydration and death. By combining water with Na+, glucose, and an amino acid (glycine), water absorption can be enhanced because this combination of ingredients can take advantage of multiple epithelial co-transport mechanisms. Enhanced solute absorption translates into increased water absorption as water follows the solute across the epithelium.

In fact, this strategy is the basis for oral rehydration solutions that are used not only in veterinary medicine, but across the developing world to treat potentially fatal diarrheas in people, including cholera.

Task 2 — colostrum:
Transfer of immunity: In ungulate species such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, the young are born essentially agammaglobulinemic and rely entirely on uptake of colostral immunoglobulins, especially IgG, for systemic immune protection. The intestinal uptake in the immediate period after birth is transient and nonselective in species such as cattle, sheep, goats, swine and others. The intestinal cells become unable to absorb macromolecules within 24–36 h after birth (in pigs, this period may be much longer) probably as a result of developmental processes occurring in the enterocytes. The process whereby the intestinal cells gradually stop absorbing macromolecules is termed closure. Before closure, the enterocytes will nonselectively absorb large molecular weight proteins and other molecules. Macromolecules so transported are released into the lamina propria and then are absorbed into the lymphatic or portal circulation. Failure of passive transfer of immunity in these species is defined as occurring when a threshold concentration of IgG is not reached before closure occurs. The maternal IgG in the calf’s blood gradually declines over the initial month after birth, and has a half-life of approximately 16 days.

Site of absorption: Morphologically, the main site of colostral absorption is the middle- to-caudal region of the small intestine. Although receptor-mediated transport of colostral IgG has been suggested, micropinocytotic transport is the predominant mechanism by which immunoglobulins are absorbed. There is no evidence for paracellular transport.
Intestinal closure occurs as more mature populations that are incapable of transporting large proteins replace fetal intestinal epithelial cells.
 
Contents of colostrum: Besides providing essential immunity, colostrum also has a purgative effect that aids in the expulsion of meconium. Colostrum also contains important nutrients (fat, protein, lactose, vitamins, and minerals) as well as other antimicrobial factors. (Most physiology texts will not contain the following detail. It is provided for tutor background.) The latter includes iron-binding antimicrobial protein lactoferrin, antibacterial enzyme lactoperoxidase, antibacterial and lytic enzyme lysozyme, oligosaccharides that function as analogues of microbial ligands on mucosal surfaces, antimicrobial heat stable peptides (defensins), and soluble CD14. In addition, colostrum and milk contain leukocytes, including activated neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. Colostrum also contains cytokines and growth factors that may affect neonatal intestinal development, as well as intestinal immune responses to disease in adults.

This case is based on MR #841543 (Loy) and Pathology case #N92-155, involving a two- day-old, live piglet delivered to the Large Animal Clinic at the College of Veterinary Medicine for necropsy examination. Although the storyline is largely developed out of the experiences of the author, the signalment, essential history, and laboratory data are derived from the case record.

CASE SUPPORTING MATERIALS:
Laboratory data, including bacterial culture and sensitivity, E. coli DNA probe diagnostics, fluorescent antibody test for TGE, and necropsy and histopathology reports, are based on MR #841543 (Loy). Histopathology slides were obtained from unrelated necropsy specimens.

Resources not included in paper case:
Histopathology slides: gut
8 - slides: stomach (cardia, fundus, pylorus), duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon

SUGGESTED CONSULTANTS:
Dr. Gerald Duhamel Dr. Antonia Jordan Dr. Kenny Simpson

Course III Knowledge Structure

The following 5-point outline provides the vital structure for the knowledge you will acquire in Block III. Using this structure, you will build a database of knowledge that is transferrable (useful) no matter the body system or species. This knowledge structure should be used to organize your studying and the way you think about clinical cases, and as a means of self-assessment.

Whole animal level
 What “services” does this system provide for theanimal?
 What clinical signs are commonly associated with dysfunction of thissystem?
System/organ level
 What are the organs in this system?
 What are the functions of the organs and tissues in this system?
 What control mechanisms(s) exist to regulate the functions(s) of thissystem?
 What factors (internal and external) can perturb the control mechanism?
 What are the consequences of loss of control of thissystem?
 How is the function of this system related to the function of other systems?
 How does this organ handle both exogenous and endogenous compounds?
Tissue/cell level
 What is the specialized structure of each of the various cell types in this organ?
 How are cells in this system specialized (structurally and functionally) to carry out the functions of the system?
 How are the different cell types organized (spatially and/or temporally) with respect to one another?
 What functions do the specialized cell types and the organization of those cell types confer on the organ?
Injury/Repair
 What are the various ways in which this system can undergoinjury?
 What lesions are commonly encountered and what is the etiology and pathogenesis of each?
 How do the tissues in this organ respond to injury?
 How do uninjured cells respond in the presence of injured cells in this organ?
 How is the function of this organ affected by injury to its cells?
 How are other systems affected by cellular injury in this organ?
 What are the clinical consequences of injury to this organsystem?
 How is cellular injury (organ dysfunction) in this organ detectedclinically?
 What is the prognosis for organ or whole animal function given a specific injury to thissystem?
Modulation
 What subcellular functions of the cells in this system are subject to modulation by exogenous and endogenous factors (drugs, toxins, neurotransmitters, hormones, etc.)?
 How is system function affected by modulation of subcellularfunctions?
 What factors enhance or impede the access of pharmacologic agents to the cells in this system?
